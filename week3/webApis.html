    <h1>what is an API</h1>
    <p>
      Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) are constructs made available in
      programming languages to allow developers to create complex functionality
      more easily. They abstract more complex code away from you, providing some
      easier syntax to use in its place.
    </p>
    <br />
    <h2>Types of APIS</h2>
    <p>
      JavaScript, Browser APIs, Third-party APIs, JavaScript libraries,
      JavaScript frameworks
    </p>
    <br />
    <h2>Common browser APIs</h2>
    <p>
      <b>APIs for manipulating documents</b> loaded into the browser. The most
      obvious example is the DOM (Document Object Model) API, which allows you
      to manipulate HTML and CSS â€” creating, removing and changing HTML,
      dynamically applying new styles to your page, etc.
    </p>
    <br />
    <p>
      <b>APIs that fetch data from the server</b>to update small sections of a
      webpage on their own are very commonly used.The main API used for this is
      the Fetch API
    </p>
    <br />
    <p>and more additional APIS</p>
